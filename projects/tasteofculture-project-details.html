                    <h5>General Info</h5>
                        <p>Taste of Culture is one of the few Jamaican and African eateries remaining in Washington, DC.  It is located inside of a convenience shop on 3501 Georgia Avenue NW, Washington.  They offer a variety of dishes coming from both cultures such as Curry Goat, Oxtail, Jollof Rice and Beef Patties. </p>

                    <h5>Project Details</h5>
                        <p>The small eatery location prevented them from receiving traction of customers in so a way to put theirselves out there on the market, I volunteered to create their website so they can hold a web prescence for their new customers.  Since it is their first time having a page we went over the key things that they would want displayed on their page. What I was able to cover is simply a display of their dishes with information, their chef and a connection to a third party service that can help increase. In total I created about 6 pages with them and establish their contact form for catering services using Mailchimp.</p>

                  <h5>Results</h5>
                    <p>As the end result I was able to get the website launched within a week using the hosting service of GoDaddy.  One of the key elements that I learned from doing this project is the backend implementation of mailchimp.  This was my first time having a successful setup of mailchimp.  Base of this experience I was able to learn what would be key elements that eateries or catering services would want for their website.</p>
