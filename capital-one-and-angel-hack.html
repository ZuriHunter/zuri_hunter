        	<p class="lead">Fifth Hackathon. Second AngelHack. </p>

            <p>This weekend I have decided to take on the challenge again to enter a hackathon competition hosted by Capital One and Angel Hack.  This is my first time going to a Capital One Hackathon, second time to an AngelHack hackahton and fifth time entering a hackathon.  From each experience I improve and learn something new.  The last hackathon I was a part of was Pearl Hacks that took place in Chapel Hill, Nort Carolina on UNC campus.  There I finally learned how to succesfully implement the image upload gem Carrierwave and AWS for my Ruby On Rails application. I was able to enter my product into the competition sadly but I learned an awful lot and made a great connection with other female tech enthusiasts.</p>
        
            <p>AngelHack was my very first hackathon that I attended.  I came as a spectator to figure out what type of things people did there. So now coming to this event as a contributor is a truly a great marker of how far I have came along with my skill. At this event I will be a Developer with having Web Design and Ruby on Rails as my main skill set.  What I hope to gain from this experience is of course expand my technology network but also learn how to implement two new gems and use an API to help deliver the idea.</p>

            <h5><italic>FAST FORWARD.....</italic></h5>

            <p>I swear it was like the most interesting turn of events at this hackathon. I arrive during the Capital One's presentation on the core issues that small businesses faced.  What I took from that presentation that the main focus that small business owners wish to do is enhance their product or service 24/7. That means that any task that deviates from progressing the core business is a setback. Those factors that Capital One named were administrative, financial and managerial duties.  When I first saw that I thought Marketing of their service would also be a factor but since the invention of social media and sharing of information that is no longer the case. In so along with that they introduced one of their new tools that stemed from their Spark services platform and offered for us to use their API to incorporate into our project.</p>

            <p>I am not too skilled with using API's in Ruby on Rails project so I thought to myself maybe this day will be it! But then the issue was that I didn't have an idea in mind for this hackathon and I felt that I was underqualified to help othe people who needed developers. From what I heard in the pitches, they were mainly looking for individuals who were proficient with dealing with APIs and used Angular.JS or any Javascript related framework. In so, I ended joining my classmate Ricardo and Simeon.</p>

                  <p>Simeon is currently a Sophomore at Howard University studying Computer Information System.  I met Simeon when I was either in my last year at Howard University. I can't remember clearly the details on how we met but I promise you it had to be through our professor. In the past I only worked on one project with him which was for DC StartUp weekend.  We created an web application called Edumatter.  It was dedicated towards creating a better platform high school students to organize their information on potential colleges and scholarships.  We did everything by using Ruby on Rails.  I promise you he is a genius when it comes to Ruby on Rails, CSS, HTML, Javascript, Java! Practically everything and he is absolutely fun and great to work with!  </p>

I have been on several projects with Ricardo.  The latest was in our System Analysis & Design class.  Our end project was to revamp Howard University's "Class Registration" system. He did an excellent job creating the database and using PHP to design it. He is pretty much our "Database"  </p>
